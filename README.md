## About me

I am Carlos, I have over seven years of experience in software development and data, primarily in consultancy, logistics, and mobility.

I am passionate about solving complex business problems, including collecting, interpreting, analyzing, and modeling data. I also like learning about management and new technologies focused on Machine Learning, MLOps, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis.

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich (Machine Learning).

- I'm looking to collaborate on data science and data engineering projects.

- I also teach computer science topics such as Python, OOP, Unit and Integration Testing with Pytest, Packaging with Python, API REST, Software Engineering, Monitoring, Observability, Docker, and GitHub Actions. Visit <https://carloslme.com/ide>

- Ask me about data engineering topics (SQL, ETL, orchestration, Spark, streaming, batch, etc), and MLOps topics.
