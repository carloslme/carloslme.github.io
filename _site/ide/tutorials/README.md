# Tutorial: Modifying the Markdown File
This tutorial will guide you step-by-step on how to modify and customize the Markdown file in this folder.

### Instructions for Modifying the File
1. **Clone the repository**  
   First, you need to clone the repository. Once cloned, you should see something like this:
   <center><img src="img/gi.png" alt="Image description" width="200" height="250"></center>

2. **Create a copy of the template**  
   First, go to this path **ide / tutorials / template.md**  
   <center><img src="img/gi2.png" alt="Image description" width="200" height="250"></center>  
   Then copy the **template.md** file into the same folder (tutorials) to modify it, and name it as you like.

3. **Front Matter**  
   Update the values within the `---` lines.
   - `layout`: Indicates the layout to be used. It should match the layout file you want to use.
   - `title`: Change the title to one that clearly describes the content of the tutorial.

4. **Tutorial Title**  
   Modify `# Tutorial Title` to reflect the main topic.

5. **Image**  
   - The line `<center><img src="img/your_image.jpg"...` allows you to insert an image.
   - Update `src` to point to the correct image path. Change `width` and `height` if you need to adjust the size.

6. **Table of Contents**  
   - Add or remove sections according to what is actually in your file.
   - Ensure each link (`[Introduction](#introduction)`) matches the section headings.

7. **Example Section**  
   - Each example has a title (`#### Example 1: Example title 1`) and a code block.
   - Update the code block and the expected result (`> The output will be:`) to be accurate.

8. **Conclusion**  
   - Summarize the key points of the tutorial here.

9. **References**  
   - List any sources that are useful for further exploration of the topic.
